# Functors and Applicatives

Examples for the Functors and Applicatives talk. [The slides are available here.](http://slides.com/qxjit/functors)

## Running the examples

You can run the examples using `runhaskell` or `node` as appropriate if you already have haskell and node installed.
If you don't you can install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and then use `./haskell` and `./node` to run them.
